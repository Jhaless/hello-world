# hello-world


This is my first time on github.
I just started to learn HTML and I hope to learn at least until JS. I want to be able to develop webpages and eventually maybe some apps.
I hope one day I can work as a freelance programmer besides a part time job. For now I need to learn. I'm using some books and w3schools.com to learn HTML/CSS together with my wife (who is a graphic designer). We are using Dreamweaver CS6 for now but we'll see which software is best for us in time. 
Github was recommended by a classmate who studies ICT and therefore I just created an account. I'm not sure yet what I can do with it but I will figure it out eventually.
